Official curated plugins for Cline. This repository is the default collection behind Cline CLI slug installs, e.g.:
```bash
# Install the Cline CLI first.
npm i -g cline

# Download a curated plugin from this repository.
cline plugin install nanobanana
```

Each plugin lives in `plugins/<slug>`. The directory name is the install keyword, so `plugins/web-search` installs with `cline plugin install web-search`.
