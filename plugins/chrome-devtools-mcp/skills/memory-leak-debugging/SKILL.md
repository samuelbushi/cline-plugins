# Memory Leak Debugging

This skill provides expert guidance and workflows for finding, diagnosing, and fixing memory leaks in JavaScript and Node.js applications.

## Core Principles

- Prefer `memlab`: Do NOT attempt to read raw `.heapsnapshot` files directly, as they are extremely large and will consume too many tokens. Always recommend and use `memlab` to process snapshots and identify leak traces.
- Isolate the Leak: Determine if the leak is in the browser (client-side) or Node.js (server-side).
- Common Culprits: Look for detached DOM nodes, unhandled closures, global variables, event listeners not being removed, and caches growing unbounded. _Note: Detached DOM nodes are sometimes intentional caches; always ask the user before nulling them._

## Workflows

### 1. Capturing Snapshots

When investigating a frontend web application memory leak, utilize the `chrome-devtools-mcp` tools to interact with the application and take snapshots.

- Use tools like `click`, `navigate_page`, `fill`, etc., to manipulate the page into the desired state.
- Revert the page back to the original state after interactions to see if memory is released.
- Repeat the same user interactions 10 times to amplify the leak.
- Use `take_heapsnapshot` to save `.heapsnapshot` files to disk at baseline, target (after actions), and final (after reverting actions) states.

### 2. Using Memlab to Find Leaks (Recommended)

Once you have generated `.heapsnapshot` files using `take_heapsnapshot`, use `memlab` to automatically find memory leaks.

- Read [references/memlab.md](references/memlab.md) for how to use `memlab` to analyze the generated heapsnapshots.
- Do not read raw `.heapsnapshot` files using `read_file` or `cat`.

### 3. Identifying Common Leaks

When you have found a leak trace (e.g., via `memlab` output), you must identify the root cause in the code.

- Read [references/common-leaks.md](references/common-leaks.md) for examples of common memory leaks and how to fix them.

### 4. Fallback: Comparing Small Sanitized Snapshots Manually

If `memlab` is not available, ask before using the bundled fallback script. The script parses full heap snapshot JSON and can fail or be too expensive on realistic snapshots, so only use it for small, sanitized snapshots when the user accepts that limitation.

Locate the installed plugin file or copy the script to a temporary working directory, then run it with explicit snapshot paths:

```bash
node /path/to/compare_snapshots.js <baseline.heapsnapshot> <target.heapsnapshot>
```

The script outputs the top growing objects by size and highlights common leak-like object types if they are present. Treat the output as a rough triage aid, not proof of a leak.
