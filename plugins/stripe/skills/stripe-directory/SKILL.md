## Stripe Directory Search

Turn a Stripe Directory or Stripe-mediated market need into a short, relevant shortlist with `stripe directory search`. Do not route generic vendor, tool, partner, or provider discovery through Stripe Directory unless the user asks for Stripe Directory, Stripe marketplace results, or Stripe-mediated payment/provisioning.

Most requests are discovery - find and compare services. That is the core job below. Some services are also MPP-supported (MPP = Machine Payment Protocol), meaning they expose HTTP 402 (Payment Required) endpoints that can be paid programmatically. Do not purchase or consume a paid endpoint unless the user explicitly asks and approves the exact price, endpoint, payer, and account.

## Process

1. Clarify only what's missing: buyer/vertical, job-to-be-done, must-have capability, geography (only if it matters).

1. Search iteratively: `stripe directory search "<query>" --format json`

   - Short noun phrases, one angle per query; run 1-3, then broaden/narrow on results.
   - Angles to cover: vertical -> workflow -> pain point -> adjacent. Two examples:
     - services/trades: vertical (`electrician software`, `electrical contractor`) -> workflow (`field service management`, `dispatch invoicing estimates`) -> pain point (`job scheduling`, `quote automation`) -> adjacent (`home services automation`, `contractor crm`).
     - SaaS/software: vertical (`b2b saas billing`, `developer tools`) -> workflow (`subscription management`, `usage-based metering`) -> pain point (`failed payment recovery`, `revenue recognition`) -> adjacent (`analytics dashboards`, `customer onboarding`).
   - Hard constraints -> filters: `--countries-supported=US`, `--has-stripe-app=true`, `--link-supported=true`, `--stripe-projects-supported=true`.
   - If the user wants to *use/buy* a service, also pass `--mpp-supported` in at least one search to find results you can pay for programmatically.
   - Sparse niche? Raise `--limit` and try the next `--page` before concluding it's empty.

1. Dedupe & score using `display_name`, `description`, `url`, `username` as evidence.

   - Prefer results whose description/site clearly match the target workflow.
   - Prefer more trust signals over fewer: Projects provider, Link enabled, Marketplace app, Stripe Verified. For buy/use intent, also prefer MPP-supported results.
   - Thin description but strong brand/domain match -> keep in a weaker bucket, don't discard.

1. Return a shortlist, not a dump - 5-10 strong matches, grouped:

   - direct / adjacent / needs manual review
   - Each entry: name, why it matched, URL, and which query surfaced it when useful.
   - Projects providers: offer the follow-up. The JSON gives the exact commands under each result's `projects.catalog_command` / `projects.install_command` (`stripe projects catalog <provider>`, `stripe projects add <provider>`).
   - MPP-supported results: note they're purchasable and include `mpp.slug` / `mpp.url`.

1. Be honest about weak results - if sparse or generic, say so and adjust: broaden, narrow, or try synonyms rather than padding with noise.

Always report the exact queries (and filters) you ran so the user can keep iterating.

## Purchasing (only when the user wants to buy or consume a service)

MPP-supported results are payable directly. Do not drive to purchase unprompted. When the user wants to buy, present the full menu of payment methods and ask which they'd like to use before doing anything:

Which payment method would you like to use?

- Link CLI - Stripe-native, test mode available (recommended)
- Tempo - crypto wallet
- Privy Agent Wallet CLI - crypto wallet
- mppx - debug-only fallback

Once the user picks, silently run `which <tool> 2>/dev/null` to check if it's installed. If not installed, offer to install it (for example, `npm i -g @stripe/link-cli` for Link CLI) and wait for confirmation before proceeding.

Always show the price and get explicit user approval before any money moves; prefer a no-charge test path first.

Short version:

1. Resolve the real callable endpoint from the result's `mpp.slug` / `mpp.url`. `mpp.url` is often the mpp.dev landing form (`https://mpp.dev/services#<slug>`). Before contacting any resolved endpoint, show the endpoint, payer, account, and reason for the probe, then ask for approval. After approval, read the HTTP 402 challenge to confirm the amount: `curl -s -D - -o /dev/null <endpoint_url>` (look for `WWW-Authenticate`).
1. Use the payer the user selected.
   - `link-cli` (Stripe-native Shared Payment Token, has a test mode, no crypto wallet, US Link accounts only; `npm i -g @stripe/link-cli`): `auth login` -> `mpp decode --challenge "<value>"` (get `network_id`) -> `spend-request create --credential-type shared_payment_token --network-id <id> --amount <cents <=50000> --context "<100+ chars>" --request-approval` (blocks for approval) -> `mpp pay <endpoint_url> --spend-request-id <approved_id>`.
   - Tempo: `tempo wallet login` / `services` / `request`.
   - Privy: `@privy-io/agent-wallet-cli`.
   - mppx: debug-only fallback.

Never invent results or skip the price/approval gate.
