# WorkOS

WorkOS adds Cline skills for implementing and debugging enterprise identity workflows.

## Cline Primitives

- Skills: `workos` routes WorkOS AuthKit, SSO/SAML, Directory Sync, RBAC, FGA, MFA, Vault, Audit Logs, Admin Portal, Pipes, Feature Flags, Radar, Events, Custom Domains, API references, CLI lifecycle, and migration requests to bundled WorkOS references.
- Skills: `workos-widgets` helps integrate WorkOS widgets such as User Management, User Profile, Admin Portal SSO Connection, and Admin Portal Domain Verification across common frontend and backend stacks.
- Rules: the WorkOS safety rule protects secrets and production identity resources, requires verified CLI/dashboard guidance, and gates mutating WorkOS operations behind explicit user confirmation.

## Requirements

- WorkOS account access and the relevant WorkOS environment variables for live implementation work, commonly `WORKOS_API_KEY`, `WORKOS_CLIENT_ID`, cookie/session secrets, webhook secrets, and widget token material.
- The WorkOS CLI when the user asks Cline to run WorkOS setup or management commands. Cline should run it with `WORKOS_MODE=agent`, and with `--json` when command output is parsed.
- Network access when the task requires current WorkOS documentation, CLI installation, or live WorkOS API calls.

## Trust Boundaries

The plugin does not register an MCP server, start background services, install dependencies, or call WorkOS at install time. It only contributes skills and a prompt rule. Live WorkOS changes remain user-approved runtime actions.

Bundled WorkOS skill material is from WorkOS plugin metadata declaring MIT licensing. See `NOTICE.workos-skills`.
