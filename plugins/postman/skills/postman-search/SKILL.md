# Discover APIs

Answer natural language questions about available APIs across Postman workspaces. Find endpoints, check response shapes, and understand what's available.

## Prerequisites

The Postman MCP Server must be connected. If MCP tools aren't available, tell the user: "Run `postman-setup` skill to configure the Postman MCP Server."

## Workflow

### Step 1: Search

1. Call `searchPostmanElementsInPrivateNetwork` with the user's query. This searches the organization's private API network and is the primary search path.
2. If private network results are sparse or private network search is not available, broaden the search:
   - Use the Postman MCP workspace-listing tool to get the user's workspace ID. If multiple workspaces exist, ask which to use. Then use `getCollections` with the `workspace` parameter. Use the `name` filter to narrow results.
   - Call `getTaggedEntities` to find collections by tag.
3. If the user is looking for a public/third-party API (e.g., Stripe, GitHub, Twilio), call `searchPostmanElementsInPublicNetwork` with the user's query.

Important: Default to `searchPostmanElementsInPrivateNetwork` for trusted APIs in user's organisation. Only use `searchPostmanElementsInPublicNetwork` when the user explicitly wants public/third-party APIs or private search returns no results.

### Step 2: Drill Into Results

For each relevant hit:
1. Call `getCollection` to get the overview
2. Scan endpoint names and descriptions for relevance
3. Call `getCollectionRequest` for the most relevant endpoints
4. Call `getCollectionResponse` to show what data is available
5. Call `getSpecDefinition` if a linked spec exists for richer detail

### Step 3: Present

Format results as a clear answer to the user's question.

When found:
```
Yes, you can get a user's email via the API.

  Endpoint: GET /users/{id}
  Collection: "User Management API"
  Auth: Bearer token required

  Response includes:
    {
      "id": "usr_123",
      "email": "jane@example.com",
      "name": "Jane Smith",
      "role": "admin"
    }
```

When not found:
```
No endpoint returns user emails.

  Closest matches:
  - GET /users/{id}/profile - returns name, avatar (no email)
  - GET /users - list view doesn't include email

  The email field might require a different permission scope,
  or it may not be exposed via API yet.
```

When multiple results:
List relevant collections with endpoint counts, then ask which to explore further.

## Error Handling

- MCP not configured: "Run `postman-setup` skill to configure the Postman MCP Server."
- No results: "Nothing matched in your private API network. Try different keywords, browse in user's workspaces, or search the public Postman network."
- 401 Unauthorized: "Postman authentication failed. Re-authorize the `postman` MCP server through Cline's MCP authorization flow."
- Too many results: Ask the user to be more specific. Suggest filtering by workspace or using tags.
