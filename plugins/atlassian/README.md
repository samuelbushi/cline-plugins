# atlassian

Atlassian Rovo MCP and skills for working with Jira, Confluence, Compass, and company knowledge from Cline.

## What It Adds

- `atlassian` MCP server over Streamable HTTP.
- `search-company-knowledge` skill for searching and citing Confluence, Jira, Compass, and internal Atlassian content.
- `spec-to-backlog` skill for turning Confluence specs into reviewed Jira epics and implementation tickets.
- `triage-issue` skill for duplicate search, bug triage, and ticket creation decisions.
- `generate-status-report` skill for Jira-based project reporting and optional Confluence publishing.
- `capture-tasks-from-meeting-notes` skill for extracting meeting action items and preparing Jira tasks.

## Install

```bash
cline plugin install atlassian
```

For local development from this repository:

```bash
cline plugin install ./plugins/atlassian --cwd .
```

By default the plugin registers the OAuth endpoint:

```text
https://mcp.atlassian.com/v1/mcp/authv2
```

After install, authorize the MCP server when prompted or run `cline mcp` and choose `Authorize OAuth`.

For API-token or service-account setups, set a full `Authorization` header value before install or reinstall:

```bash
ATLASSIAN_MCP_AUTHORIZATION="Basic <base64-email-and-token>"
```

or:

```bash
ATLASSIAN_MCP_AUTHORIZATION="Bearer <service-account-token>"
```

When `ATLASSIAN_MCP_AUTHORIZATION` is set, the plugin registers `https://mcp.atlassian.com/v1/mcp` with the static header instead of the OAuth endpoint.

Cline reads this environment variable when syncing plugin MCP settings. If you change it later, reinstall or re-enable the plugin so the stored MCP setting is rewritten.

## Requirements

- Cline with plugin MCP registration and remote MCP OAuth support.
- Atlassian Cloud access to Jira, Confluence, Compass, or the relevant products.
- A browser for OAuth authorization, or an organization-enabled Atlassian MCP API token flow.
- User permissions for the projects, spaces, and components being searched or changed.

## Security Notes

The Atlassian MCP acts with the authorized user's Atlassian permissions. It can search private company knowledge and can create or update Jira issues, Confluence pages, and Compass data when the user has access.

The bundled skills require explicit confirmation before creating Jira issues, updating existing issues, publishing Confluence pages, adding comments, linking content, or making bulk changes. Search results and generated reports should cite source pages or issues and avoid exposing confidential content beyond the current task.
