# Post-Processing Pipeline

The `validate_aws_drawio` Cline tool runs deterministic fixers before validation, in this order:

1. fix_nesting.py - Sets Region `container=0`, re-parents children to root
2. fix_icon_colors.py - Corrects service icon fillColor to match category
3. fix_step_badges.py - Nudges overlapping step badges apart
4. fix_placement.py - Moves external actors below the title block (y >= 140)
5. fix_legend_size.py - Resizes legend panel to match diagram height

All scripts are bundled with the plugin in `scripts/lib/`. The pipeline is orchestrated by `scripts/lib/post_process_drawio.py`, which chains them in sequence. Use the `validate_aws_drawio` tool rather than calling these scripts directly.

Dependency: The pipeline requires `defusedxml` (`pip3 install defusedxml>=0.7.1`). If missing, `validate_aws_drawio` returns an install prompt.
