name: duckdb-convert-file
description: >
  Convert any data file to another format: CSV, Parquet, JSON, Excel, GeoJSON, and more.
  Use when the user says "convert to parquet", "save as xlsx", "export as JSON", "make this a CSV",
  "turn into parquet", or any variation of format-to-format conversion for data files.
  Also triggers when the user wants to write Parquet, Excel, or other binary formats that Cline cannot produce natively.

You are helping the user convert a data file from one format to another using DuckDB.

Input file: use the input path the user provided in the current request.
Output file: use the requested output path if one was provided; otherwise infer it from the input path.

## Step 1 - Resolve input and output

Input: the requested input path. If it is a bare filename (no `/`), resolve to a full path with `find "$PWD" -name "<input filename>" -not -path '*/.git/*' 2>/dev/null | head -1`.

Output: If an output path is provided, use it as the output path. If not, default to the same stem as the input with a `.parquet` extension (e.g., `data.csv` -> `data.parquet`).

Before writing, show the resolved input path, output path, and inferred output format. Ask for confirmation if the output path was inferred, if it already exists, or if the conversion writes outside the workspace.

Infer the output format from the output file extension:

| Extension | Format clause |
|---|---|
| `.parquet`, `.pq` | *(default, no clause needed)* |
| `.csv` | `(FORMAT csv, HEADER)` |
| `.tsv` | `(FORMAT csv, HEADER, DELIMITER '\t')` |
| `.json` | `(FORMAT json, ARRAY true)` |
| `.jsonl`, `.ndjson` | `(FORMAT json, ARRAY false)` |
| `.xlsx` | `(FORMAT xlsx)` - requires `INSTALL excel; LOAD excel;` |
| `.geojson` | `(FORMAT GDAL, DRIVER 'GeoJSON')` - requires `LOAD spatial;` |
| `.gpkg` | `(FORMAT GDAL, DRIVER 'GPKG')` - requires `LOAD spatial;` |
| `.shp` | `(FORMAT GDAL, DRIVER 'ESRI Shapefile')` - requires `LOAD spatial;` |

## Step 2 - Convert

Run a single DuckDB command. Prepend extension loads as needed based on both the input and output formats.

```bash
duckdb -c "
<EXTENSION_LOADS>
COPY (FROM '<INPUT_PATH>') TO '<OUTPUT_PATH>' <FORMAT_CLAUSE>;
"
```

For remote inputs (`s3://`, `https://`, etc.), prepend the same protocol setup as `read-file`:

| Protocol | Prepend |
|---|---|
| `s3://` | `LOAD httpfs; CREATE SECRET (TYPE S3, PROVIDER credential_chain);` |
| `gs://` / `gcs://` | `LOAD httpfs; CREATE SECRET (TYPE GCS, PROVIDER credential_chain);` |
| `https://` / `http://` | `LOAD httpfs;` |

If the user mentions partitioning (e.g., "partition by year"), add `PARTITION_BY (col)` to the format clause. This only works with Parquet and CSV output.

If the user mentions compression (e.g., "use zstd"), add `CODEC 'zstd'` for Parquet output.

## Step 3 - Report

On success, report:
- Input file and detected format
- Output file, format, and size (`ls -lh`)
- Row count if quick to compute

On failure:
- `duckdb: command not found` -> delegate to `duckdb-setup`
- Missing extension -> invoke `duckdb-setup <extension>` and retry after the user confirms the install
- Input parse error -> suggest the user check the input format or try `duckdb-read-file` first to inspect it
