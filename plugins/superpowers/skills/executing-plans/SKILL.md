# Executing Plans

## Overview

Load plan, review critically, execute all tasks, report when complete.

__Announce at start:__ "I'm using the executing-plans skill to implement this plan."

__Note:__ Tell your human partner that Superpowers works much better with access to subagents. The quality of its work will be significantly higher if run on a platform with subagent support (such as Claude Code or Codex). If subagents are available, use superpowers:subagent-driven-development instead of this skill.

## The Process

### Step 1: Load and Review Plan
1. Read plan file
2. Review critically - identify any questions or concerns about the plan
3. If concerns: Raise them with your human partner before starting
4. If no concerns: Create TodoWrite and proceed

### Step 2: Execute Tasks

For each task:
1. Mark as in_progress
2. Follow each step exactly (plan has bite-sized steps)
3. Run verifications as specified
4. Mark as completed

### Step 3: Complete Development

After all tasks complete and verified:
- Announce: "I'm using the finishing-a-development-branch skill to complete this work."
- __REQUIRED SUB-SKILL:__ Use superpowers:finishing-a-development-branch
- Follow that skill to verify tests, present options, execute choice

## When to Stop and Ask for Help

__STOP executing immediately when:__
- Hit a blocker (missing dependency, test fails, instruction unclear)
- Plan has critical gaps preventing starting
- You don't understand an instruction
- Verification fails repeatedly

__Ask for clarification rather than guessing.__

## When to Revisit Earlier Steps

__Return to Review (Step 1) when:__
- Partner updates the plan based on your feedback
- Fundamental approach needs rethinking

__Don't force through blockers__ - stop and ask.

## Remember
- Review plan critically first
- Follow plan steps exactly
- Don't skip verifications
- Reference skills when plan says to
- Stop when blocked, don't guess
- Never start implementation on main/master branch without explicit user consent

## Integration

__Required workflow skills:__
- __superpowers:using-git-worktrees__ - Ensures isolated workspace (creates one or verifies existing)
- __superpowers:writing-plans__ - Creates the plan this skill executes
- __superpowers:finishing-a-development-branch__ - Complete development after all tasks
