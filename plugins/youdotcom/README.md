# You.com

You.com adds Cline skills for web search, research with citations, content extraction, and agent framework integrations.

## Cline Primitives

- Skills: `youdotcom-api` helps integrate You.com Research, Search, and Contents APIs using direct HTTP calls in any language.
- Skills: `youdotcom-cli` provides curl and jq workflows for search, research, and content extraction.
- Skills: `ydc-ai-sdk-integration`, `ydc-langchain-integration`, `ydc-crewai-mcp-integration`, `ydc-claude-agent-sdk-integration`, and `ydc-openai-agent-sdk-integration` guide You.com tool or MCP integration into common agent frameworks.
- Skills: `teams-anthropic-integration` helps add Anthropic Claude models to Microsoft Teams.ai apps, with optional You.com MCP search/content tools.
- Rules: `youdotcom:safety` keeps API keys and fetched web content within explicit trust boundaries and requires approval before package installs, project writes, or live integration runs.

## Requirements

- `YDC_API_KEY` is required for Research, Contents, higher rate limits, and most MCP integrations. You.com Search has a limited free tier without an API key.
- Framework-specific skills may also require Anthropic, OpenAI, Microsoft Teams, crewAI, LangChain, Vercel AI SDK, Python, Node.js, Bun, curl, or jq depending on the requested integration path.
- Network access is required for live You.com API/MCP calls and package installation.

## Trust Boundaries

The plugin does not register an MCP server, install dependencies, call You.com, or write MCP settings at install time. It contributes skills and a safety rule only. You.com API and MCP calls are user-requested runtime actions.
